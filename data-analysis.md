# Data Analysis for Scientific Research

I provide data analysis services for scientific research, with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and meaningful interpretation of experimental data. I use Python and Excel for data analysis and visualization.

## Services I provide

### → Data Processing & Cleaning
Preparation of raw measurement data, noise reduction, outlier handling, uncertainty-aware preprocessing, format conversion, and reproducible data pipelines.

### → Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics, regression models, hypothesis testing, and model validation.  
Familiar with advanced approaches such as weighted least squares, error propagation, bootstrap methods, Monte Carlo simulations, and more

### → Signal & Spectral Analysis
Time-series analysis, digital filtering, Fourier and frequency-domain methods, peak detection, curve fitting, deconvolution, and baseline correction.

### → Modeling & Parameter Estimation
Nonlinear curve fitting, optimization techniques, inverse problems, and parameter extraction from experimental data.

### → Visualization & Reporting
Clear scientific plots and data visualizations with a focus on interpretability and reproducibility.

### → Reproducible Workflows
Python-based analysis scripts and structured project organization following FAIR data principles.



### If you need support analyzing scientific data, feel free to get in touch.
